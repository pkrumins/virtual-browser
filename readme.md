# What Are Virtual Browser Use Cases?

## Visit Blocked Websites

A virtual browser lets you open sites that might be blocked at school, work, or in your country.

## Test Sites on Different Browsers

You can cross-browser test how your website looks and works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and more without installing them.

## Click Suspicious Links Safely

If you're not sure about a link, open it in a virtual browser to see what it does without risking your system.
